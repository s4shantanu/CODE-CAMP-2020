                        The COVID-19 virus is a new virus linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory

                        chronic medical conditions,â€¯such as diabetes and heart disease,â€¯appear to be more at risk of developing 
                        severe symptoms.â€¯ As this is a new virus, we are still learning about how it affects children. We know it is 
                        possible for people of any age to be infected with the virus, but so far there are relatively few cases of 
                        COVID-19 reported among children. This is a new virus and we need to learn more about how it affects 
                        children. The virus can be fatal in rare cases, so far mainly among older people with pre-existing medical 
                        conditions.

                    <p><ul><li>The petrifying and severe impact of COVID-19 has shaken the world to its core. Further, most of the Governments around the world have temporarily closed educational institutions in an attempt to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In India too, the government as a part of the nationwide lockdown has closed all educational institutions, as a consequence of which, learners ranging from school going children to postgraduate students, are affected.The UNESCO report estimates that the coronavirus pandemic will adversely impact over 290 million students across 22 countries.</li></ul></p>

Several other countries have implemented localized closures impacting millions of additional learners. The UNESCO estimates that about 32 crores students are affected in India, including those in schools and colleges. The UNESCO is supporting countries in their efforts to mitigate the immediate impact of school closures, particularly for more vulnerable and disadvantaged communities, and to facilitate the continuity of education for all through remote learning. </li></ul></p>

                               <li>The government has come up with e-learning program. Many ed-tech firms have tried to leverage the occasion by offering free online classes or attractive discounts on e-learning modules. These measures have been met with overwhelming response by students with some startups witnessing as high as 25% uptick in e-learning. Remote learning seems a viable solution to students during this time as they offer convenient, on -the- go and affordable access to lessons. E-learning also comes as an interesting and interactive alternative as compared to classroom teaching.</li></ul></p>

     <div id="edu6">
         <p><ul><li>Covid-19 has prompted experts to rethink the conventional mode of education. Digital education appears to be a viable solution to fill in the void for classroom education for a period of three to four months while minimizing the chances of any infection to students until classes resume. More importantly, it has also brought the hitherto peripheral issue of digital education in India to the centre stage. Going forward, digital education is likely to be integrated into mainstream education. This will enable inclusive education by facilitating learning across diverse geographies in India. Moreover, it will provide an opportunity for educators to come up with customized learning solutions for every student. A complete revolution in the way we learn today has been brought about by Technology. Each student gets in contact with a world-class education, which is not easy to impart by the traditional white chalk and blackboard method of teaching. This new learning is more interesting, personalized and enjoyable. A massive open online course (MOOC) is an online course aimed at unlimited participation and open access via the web. India is considered to be the biggest market for MOOCs in the world after the USA. Since the population of India is huge, massive open online course (MOOC) is said to open gateways for a lot of Indians in terms of bringing an educational revolution. Online distant learning programs give a great opportunity to avail high-quality learning with the help of internet connectivity.
            Digital learning has many advantages in itself like digital learning has no physical boundaries, it has more learning engagement experience rather than the traditional learning, it is also cost-effective and students get to learn in the confines of their comfort zone. However, digital learning is not without its limitations and challenges, since face-to-face interaction is usually perceived as the best form of communication as compared to the rather impersonalized nature of remote learning. Globally, online education has met with some success.</li></ul></p>
            <p class="edu7">However, Chidren and youth are groups that have encountered a massive hit from this crisis. As institutions have been ordered to close, fir the time being, students are forced to turn to the virtual world to continue their learning. This has led to a major reveal of global inequality as many pupils worldwide don't have access to devices or even an available network. Currently, more than 1.2 billion children in 186 countries are out of school. The sudden shift from the classroom has not only affected their stress and anxiety levels of school but has taken the essence of their normal lives away from friends and school environment. </p>
            <p class="edu8">Another challenge is that e-learning comes across as somewhat patchy and impersonal experience. Also, e-learning is likely to witness a high dropout rate due to the lack of atmosphere for studying. Students might tend to get distracted by gaming consoles, social media at home and might not feel a sense of community while taking online classes.Successful delivery of education is also in question because learning at the level of higher education and learning at the kindergarten/school level can be different. Digital education cannot be applied the same at every level of the education.</p>
